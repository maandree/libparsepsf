NAME
	libparsepsf - Library for interpreting PSF (PC Screen Font) files.

DESCRIPTION
	libparsepsf is a C library for interpreting PSF (PC Screen Font) files.
	It can be used to examine the contents of a font file, and look up
	glyphs to use a for a text. It does not render text, instead the user
	is given enough information to implement it's own rendering; nor is
	the library capable of creating PSF files.
